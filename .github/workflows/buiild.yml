      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # This action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository

          cache: 'gradle' # Cache Gradle dependencies for faster builds

      # Step 3: Set up Node.js (LTS version)

      - name: Make gradlew executable
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # Step 6: Install Node.js dependencies and build the site-source project (Astro build)

      # within the root of your repository.

      # and should now contain the correctly built Astro assets.
