# Contributing to SimC
## Raising issues
Please feel free to add issues for feature requests or bug reports. We do work on this in our spare time, for free, so the issues
that get processed tend to be the ones that are of most interest to us or scratch itches that we share.
### Labeling issues
Please start your issue titles with "Bug-" for bug reports or "Feature-" for feature requests.

Please only include one item in each issue (ie don't say "I would like this feature, and THIS feature and THAT feature" in one issue).

For bug reports please include an example circuit (or a link to one) that exhibits the bug and the steps to reproduce the bug.

For feature requests please explain why you would find this feature useful - what new work-flow would it support or what type of application would it assist with.
